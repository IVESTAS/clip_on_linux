This is a gpu-screen-recorder script to save replay buffers for Hyprland. You will have to have a global bind set
in your hyprland.conf.

Examples:
    bind = SUPER, F10, pass, screen_record, save
    bind = SUPER, F7,  pass, screen_record, kill

You will also have to set the directory you want recordings to save into in main.rs.

I don't program. This is my first script ever made in rust. If you don't like something make a pr, otherwise eat a dick because
im trill as fuck.

Also, I haven't tested but that kill keybind for hyprland prolly wont kill the process, but save will.
I'll fix that later
